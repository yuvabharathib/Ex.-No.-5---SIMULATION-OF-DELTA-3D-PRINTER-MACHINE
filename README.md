## REQUIREMENTS:
### ‚óè	System - Windows 7 or higher, 1 GB RAM.

## PROCEDURE:

## Assembly of Delta 3D Printer
### 1.	Select 'Assembly of Delta 3D Printer' from the visible list.
### 2.	All the parts related to Delta 3D Printer will be shown on the screen.
### 3.	Select the parts in sequence in which they are shown.
### 4.	When the first part is selected then it will open in the blank space in the left side of the screen.
### 5.	Further, when the correct part will be selected then it will get assembled with the previously selected part/parts.
### 6.	If the user follows an incorrect sequence then a pop-up will appear on the screen showing the name of the part to be selected.

## Playing with Axes
### 1.	Move the z1-axis slider or enter the value (within the given range) in the given text box and press/select ENTER. Now observe the movement of the z1-axis assembly.
### 2.	Move the z2-axis slider or enter the value (within the given range) in the given text box and press/select ENTER. Now observe the movement of the z2-axis assembly.
### 3.	Move the z3-axis slider or enter the value (within the given range) in the given text box and press/select ENTER. Now observe the movement of the z3-axis assembly.

## BASE :
## he foundation of the printer, typically made of sturdy materials such as metal or plastic.
## HOLDER :
## A part that holds the linear rails and/or motor in place
## ROD :
## vertical rails that the printer's effector (the part that moves around to print) travels up and down.
## TOP COVER FRAME :
## A frame that supports the top cover
## LINEAR RAIL :
## A type of guide rail that provides smooth, precise movement for the printer's effector.
## MOTOR :
## A motor that provides the movement for the printer's effector, often using belts or pulleys to transfer the motion.
## BED :
## The platform on which the printer creates the printed object.
## SLIDE WITH CONNECTOR :
## A connector that attaches the bed to the printer's frame.
## CONNECTING RODS :
## Rods that connect the printer's effector to the bed, allowing it to move up and down.
## EXTRUDER :
## The part of the printer that melts and deposits the filament used to create the printed object.
## PINS :
## Small pins used to secure various parts of the printer together.
## MOTOR WITH GEAR :
## A motor that has a gear attached to it, often used to drive the printer's linear rails.
## LCD :
## A display screen that allows the user to interact with the printer, typically used to select and control print settings.

### Name: YUVABHARATHI B
### Register Number: 212222230181

## Result: 
### Thus the simulation on construction of delta 3D printer is completed & movement of axis along X, Y, & Z has been studied.
